### How Progress Monitoring Works

#### 1. Data Collection

Progress monitoring relies on data collected from the user’s interactions with the app, ensuring that the insights provided are accurate and up-to-date.

* **Diagnostic Test Results**: The process begins with the user’s performance on the Diagnostic Test (49 questions: 27 Reading and Writing, 22 Math), which establishes a baseline `theta` score (a measure of proficiency) for each domain and subskill. These scores are stored in the app’s database and serve as the starting point for tracking progress.
* **Practice Sessions**: As the user completes practice sessions (e.g., 5-question or 10-question sessions targeting specific subskills), the app records their performance, including `theta` scores, correct/incorrect answers, and time spent per question. This data is used to update the user’s proficiency metrics.
* **Full-Length Tests**: The app includes 8 full-length SAT practice tests (2 in Phase 1, 2 in Phase 2, 4 in Phase 3 of the Study Plan). Performance on these tests, including overall scores, domain-specific scores, and subskill-specific `theta` scores, is tracked to provide a comprehensive view of the user’s readiness.
* **User Activity**: The app also tracks the user’s engagement with the Study Plan, such as completed tasks, points earned, and time spent studying, to provide a holistic picture of their preparation efforts.

#### 2. Analytics and Metrics

Progress monitoring uses advanced analytics to process the collected data, generating meaningful metrics and insights that help users understand their performance and progress.

* **Theta Scores**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app calculates a `theta` score for each domain (Reading & Writing, Math) and subskill (e.g., Grammar, Algebra) after every practice session or test. The `theta` score, derived using Item Response Theory (IRT), represents the user’s proficiency on a scale (e.g., -3 to 3), where higher scores indicate greater mastery.
  * **How It’s Used**: Theta scores are the primary metric for tracking progress. For example, a user might start with a Grammar `theta` of 0.3 and improve to 0.6 after several practice sessions, indicating growth in that subskill.
* **Performance Trends**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app analyzes the user’s `theta` scores over time to identify trends, such as whether a subskill’s performance is improving, declining, or stagnant. For instance, if a user’s Geometry `theta` drops from 0.5 to 0.4 over two weeks, the app flags this as a declining trend.
  * **How It’s Used**: Trends are displayed in the progress monitoring section, helping users see which subskills are improving and which need more attention. Declining or stagnant trends trigger recommendations (e.g., "Focus on Geometry to reverse this decline").
* **Improvement Rates**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app calculates the rate of improvement for each subskill by measuring the change in `theta` scores over time (e.g., `theta` change per week). For example, if a user’s Algebra `theta` improves from 0.4 to 0.6 over two weeks, the improvement rate is 0.1 `theta` per week.
  * **How It’s Used**: Improvement rates help users understand the pace of their progress. Slow improvement rates (e.g., less than 0.1 `theta` per week) indicate areas that need more focus, while fast rates (e.g., more than 0.2 `theta` per week) show where the user is excelling.
* **Time Spent per Question**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app tracks the average time spent per question for each subskill during practice sessions and tests. It identifies subskills where the user spends excessive time (e.g., more than 60 seconds per question), indicating potential difficulty or inefficiency.
  * **How It’s Used**: This metric is used to provide pacing feedback (e.g., "You’re spending 90 seconds per question on Reading Comprehension, which is above the target of 60 seconds") and to inform the Study Plan by scheduling pacing tasks for subskills with issues.
* **Score History**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app records the user’s overall scores from full-length tests, providing a historical view of their performance (e.g., "March 1, 2025: 1250; March 15, 2025: 1300").
  * **How It’s Used**: Score history helps users see their overall progress toward their target SAT score, motivating them to continue improving.

#### 3. Progress Monitoring Interface

The progress monitoring feature is accessible via the app’s dashboard, where users can view a detailed breakdown of their performance and progress.
