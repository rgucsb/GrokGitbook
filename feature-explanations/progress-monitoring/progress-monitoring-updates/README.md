# Progress monitoring Updates

Let’s enhance the **Progress Monitoring** feature in the **SAT Smart Prep App** by **Learner Labs** to improve the user interface (UI) for performance monitoring. Instead of displaying the `theta` score (a backend metric ranging from -3 to 3) directly to users, we’ll transform it into a more intuitive scale of **0 to 100% mastery** for domains (Reading & Writing, Math) and subskills (e.g., Grammar, Algebra). This change will make the progress monitoring UI more user-friendly and easier to understand, while the backend continues to use `theta` for all calculations, ensuring consistency in analytics and Study Plan generation. This explanation focuses on the UI transformation and user experience, without modifying or including any code, as requested.

### Enhancing Progress Monitoring with an Intuitive Mastery Scale

#### Overview

The **Progress Monitoring** feature in the SAT Smart Prep App provides users with a detailed view of their SAT preparation progress, tracking performance across domains (Reading & Writing, Math) and subskills (e.g., Grammar, Algebra). Previously, the app displayed `theta` scores (ranging from -3 to 3) to represent proficiency, which, while accurate for backend calculations, can be confusing for users unfamiliar with Item Response Theory (IRT). To improve the user experience, the app now transforms the `theta` scores into a more intuitive **0 to 100% mastery scale** for display in the UI. This scale makes it easier for users to understand their progress, while the backend continues to use `theta` for all calculations, ensuring that analytics, Study Plan updates, and practice session adjustments remain precise and data-driven.

The mastery scale is applied across all progress monitoring elements, including domain-level insights, subskill breakdowns, performance trends, and improvement rates, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience. This change enhances the app’s accessibility, making it more approachable for users of all levels while maintaining the robustness of its underlying analytics.

### How the Mastery Scale Works in the UI

#### 1. Transforming Theta to Mastery Percentage

The `theta` score, which ranges from -3 to 3 in the backend, is transformed into a 0 to 100% mastery scale for display in the UI. This transformation ensures that users see their progress in a familiar and intuitive format.

* **Backend Theta Range**: The `theta` score, calculated using IRT, ranges from -3 (lowest proficiency) to 3 (highest proficiency), with 0 representing average proficiency.
* **UI Mastery Scale**: The `theta` score is mapped to a 0 to 100% scale using a linear transformation:
  * `theta` of -3 maps to 0% mastery (lowest proficiency).
  * `theta` of 0 maps to 50% mastery (average proficiency).
  * `theta` of 3 maps to 100% mastery (highest proficiency).
* **Transformation Formula**: The mastery percentage is calculated as:
  * Mastery (%) = (`theta` + 3) / 6 \* 100
  * Example: A `theta` of 1.5 becomes (1.5 + 3) / 6 \* 100 = 75% mastery.
* **Backend Consistency**: While the UI displays the mastery percentage, the backend continues to use the `theta` score for all calculations, such as determining focus areas in the Study Plan, adjusting practice session difficulty, and calculating performance trends.

#### 2. Displaying Mastery in the Progress Monitoring Interface

The progress monitoring section, accessible via the app’s dashboard, now uses the 0 to 100% mastery scale to present the user’s performance in a clear and intuitive way.

* **Dashboard Overview**:
  * **Overall Mastery**: Instead of showing an estimated SAT score based on `theta`, the dashboard displays an overall mastery percentage for the user’s combined performance across Reading & Writing and Math. For example, if the user’s average `theta` across both domains is 1.2, this translates to 70% mastery, displayed as "Overall Mastery: 70%".
  * **Domain-Level Mastery**: Each domain (Reading & Writing, Math) is shown with its mastery percentage. For instance, a Reading & Writing `theta` of 0.6 becomes 60% mastery, displayed as "Reading & Writing Mastery: 60%", and a Math `theta` of 1.8 becomes 80% mastery, displayed as "Math Mastery: 80%".
  * **Score History**: The user’s score history from full-length tests is still displayed as SAT scores (e.g., "March 1, 2025: 1250; March 15, 2025: 1300"), but the app also shows the corresponding overall mastery percentage for each test (e.g., "March 1, 2025: 1250 (62% Mastery)").
* **Subskill Breakdown**:
  * **Subskill Mastery**: Each subskill (e.g., Grammar, Algebra) is displayed with its mastery percentage. For example, a Grammar `theta` of 0.3 becomes 55% mastery, shown as "Grammar Mastery: 55%", and an Algebra `theta` of -0.6 becomes 40% mastery, shown as "Algebra Mastery: 40%".
  * **Trends and Improvement Rates**: Performance trends and improvement rates are also presented in terms of mastery percentage changes. For instance, if a user’s Grammar `theta` improves from 0.3 to 0.6 over a week, this is shown as "Grammar Mastery: Improved from 55% to 60% (+5% per week)".
  * **Pacing Insights**: Pacing data remains in seconds (e.g., "Reading Comprehension: 90 seconds per question, target 60 seconds"), but the app highlights subskills with pacing issues in the context of their mastery percentage (e.g., "Reading Comprehension Mastery: 60%, but pacing needs improvement").
* **Visualizations**:
  * **Progress Charts**: Line graphs now show mastery percentages over time instead of `theta` scores. For example, a chart for Grammar might show a line increasing from 55% to 60% over four weeks, making it easy for users to see their progress.
  * **Subskill Heatmap**: The heatmap uses mastery percentages to color-code subskills (e.g., green for subskills with mastery > 80%, yellow for 50–80%, red for < 50%), providing a quick visual overview of the user’s performance.
  * **Score History Graph**: The score history graph remains in SAT score format (400–1600), but a secondary axis or tooltip shows the corresponding mastery percentage for each test, helping users correlate their overall score with their mastery level.

#### 3. Integration with Other Features

The mastery scale is seamlessly integrated with other app features, ensuring a consistent user experience while the backend continues to use `theta` for calculations.

* **Study Plan Updates**:
  * **How It Works**: The Study Plan uses `theta` scores in the backend to allocate tasks, but the UI displays mastery percentages when showing progress (e.g., "Your Grammar Mastery is 55%, so we’ve scheduled more Grammar practice sessions"). Recommendations are also presented in terms of mastery (e.g., "Focus on Algebra to increase your mastery from 40% to 50%").
  * **Benefit**: Users understand their Study Plan priorities in a familiar percentage format, while the backend ensures precise task allocation based on `theta`.
* **Practice Session Optimization**:
  * **How It Works**: Practice sessions are tailored using `theta` scores in the backend, but the UI shows mastery percentages when providing feedback (e.g., "Your Algebra Mastery is 40%; let’s work on improving it with this session"). If a user’s mastery in a subskill improves significantly (e.g., from 40% to 60%), the app adjusts the difficulty of questions accordingly.
  * **Benefit**: Users see their progress in an intuitive format, while the app maintains accuracy in question selection and difficulty adjustment.
* **Review Process Feedback**:
  * **How It Works**: After a practice session or full-length test, the review process shows mastery percentages for each subskill (e.g., "Your Grammar Mastery improved to 60% in this test"). Feedback on pacing and subskill performance is also presented in the context of mastery (e.g., "Reading Comprehension Mastery: 60%, but you spent 90 seconds per question").
  * **Benefit**: Users can easily interpret their performance improvements and pacing issues in terms of mastery, making the feedback more actionable.
* **Score Improvement Guarantee**:
  * **How It Works**: The app uses `theta` scores in the backend to calculate eligibility for the 150-point score improvement guarantee, but the UI shows the user’s progress toward this goal in terms of mastery (e.g., "Your overall mastery increased from 62% to 70%, corresponding to a 120-point score improvement. Keep going to reach the 150-point guarantee!").
  * **Benefit**: Users can track their progress toward the guarantee in a more intuitive way, while the backend ensures accurate score calculations.

#### 4. Recommendations and Actionable Insights

Progress monitoring provides recommendations and insights using the mastery scale, making them more accessible and actionable for users.

* **Subskill Focus**:
  * **How It Works**: The app identifies subskills with low mastery percentages (e.g., "Algebra Mastery: 40%") and recommends focusing on them (e.g., "Increase your Algebra Mastery to 50% by completing more practice sessions").
  * **Benefit**: Users can easily understand which subskills need improvement and set clear goals in terms of mastery percentage.
* **Pacing Tips**:
  * **How It Works**: For subskills with pacing issues, the app provides tips in the context of mastery (e.g., "Reading Comprehension Mastery: 60%, but you’re spending 90 seconds per question. Try skimming passages to improve your pacing and boost your mastery").
  * **Benefit**: Users see how pacing issues impact their mastery, motivating them to address these inefficiencies.
* **Progress Milestones**:
  * **How It Works**: The app highlights milestones in terms of mastery (e.g., "Your overall mastery improved from 65% to 75%, bringing you closer to your target SAT score!").
  * **Benefit**: Celebrating milestones in a percentage format makes progress feel more tangible and motivating.
* **Test Readiness**:
  * **How It Works**: The app assesses test readiness using mastery percentages (e.g., "Your overall mastery is 75%, corresponding to an estimated SAT score of 1350. Increase your mastery to 80% to reach your target of 1400").
  * **Benefit**: Users can easily understand their readiness and the mastery level needed to achieve their target score.
