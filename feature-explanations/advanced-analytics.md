### How Advanced Analytics Are Used in the App

#### 1. Personalizing the Study Plan

The Study Plan in the SAT Smart Prep App uses advanced analytics to create a tailored preparation roadmap that evolves with the user’s progress. The analytics ensure that the Study Plan focuses on the user’s most pressing needs, optimizing their study time for maximum impact.

* **Performance Trends**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app tracks the user’s `theta` scores (a measure of proficiency) for each domain (Reading & Writing, Math) and subskill (e.g., Grammar, Algebra) over time. It calculates the trend by comparing the latest `theta` score to previous scores, identifying whether a subskill’s performance is improving, declining, or stagnant.
  * **How It’s Used**: Subskills with negative or stagnant trends (e.g., no improvement in Geometry over two weeks) are prioritized in the Study Plan. For example, if a user’s `theta` for Geometry drops from 0.5 to 0.4, the Study Plan will allocate more practice sessions to Geometry to address this decline. Conversely, subskills with strong positive trends (e.g., Grammar improving from 0.3 to 0.6) receive fewer sessions, allowing the user to focus on other areas.
  * **Benefit**: Ensures the Study Plan remains relevant by focusing on subskills that need the most attention, preventing users from spending unnecessary time on areas where they are already improving.
* **Improvement Rates**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app calculates the rate of improvement for each subskill by analyzing the change in `theta` scores over time (e.g., `theta` change per week). This metric indicates how quickly a user is progressing in a given subskill.
  * **How It’s Used**: Subskills with slow improvement rates (e.g., less than 0.1 `theta` per week) are given higher priority in the Study Plan. For instance, if a user’s Algebra `theta` improves by only 0.05 per week, the Study Plan will schedule more Algebra practice sessions to accelerate progress. Subskills with fast improvement rates (e.g., more than 0.2 `theta` per week) are deprioritized, as the user is already making strong progress.
  * **Benefit**: Helps users focus on subskills where progress is slower, ensuring balanced improvement across all areas and preventing plateaus in key skills.
* **Time Spent per Question**:
  * **What It Measures**: The app tracks the average time spent per question for each subskill during practice sessions and tests. It identifies subskills where the user spends excessive time (e.g., more than 60 seconds per question), indicating potential difficulty or inefficiency.
  * **How It’s Used**: If a user spends too much time on a subskill (e.g., 90 seconds per question on Reading Comprehension), the Study Plan includes pacing tasks to improve efficiency (e.g., "Practice pacing for Reading Comprehension"). These tasks are scheduled in Phase 1 (Foundation Building) to address pacing issues early in the preparation process.
  * **Benefit**: Improves the user’s time management skills, ensuring they can complete the SAT within the allotted time while maintaining accuracy.

#### 2. Optimizing Practice Sessions

Advanced analytics are used to tailor practice sessions, ensuring that users work on the right subskills at the right time, with tasks that address their specific challenges.

* **Subskill Prioritization**:
  * **How It Works**: The app uses `theta` scores, performance trends, and improvement rates to determine which subskills to include in practice sessions. For example, if a user’s `theta` for Grammar is low (e.g., 0.3), the trend is stagnant, and the improvement rate is slow, the app will schedule more Grammar-focused practice sessions.
  * **Benefit**: Ensures that practice sessions target the user’s weakest areas, helping them improve where it matters most.
* **Pacing and Strategy Tasks**:
  * **How It Works**: If the app detects pacing issues (e.g., excessive time spent on Reading Comprehension questions), it schedules strategy-focused tasks within practice sessions (e.g., "Practice pacing for Reading Comprehension"). In Phase 2 (Practice and Strategy), the app also includes tasks like "Review strategies for Geometry" for subskills with slow improvement rates, helping users develop effective test-taking strategies.
  * **Benefit**: Helps users improve their efficiency and develop strategies to tackle challenging subskills, enhancing overall test performance.
* **Adaptive Difficulty**:
  * **How It Works**: The app uses `theta` scores to adjust the difficulty of questions in practice sessions. For subskills with low `theta` scores, the app starts with easier questions and gradually increases difficulty as the user improves. For subskills with high `theta` scores, the app includes more challenging questions to push the user further.
  * **Benefit**: Ensures that practice sessions are appropriately challenging, helping users build confidence while progressively improving their skills.

#### 3. Enhancing Progress Monitoring

Advanced analytics provide detailed insights into the user’s progress, helping them understand their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

* **Performance Trends Visualization**:
  * **How It Works**: The app displays the user’s `theta` score trends over time for each domain and subskill in the progress monitoring section. For example, a user might see that their Grammar `theta` has improved from 0.3 to 0.6 over four weeks, while their Geometry `theta` has remained stagnant at 0.4.
  * **Benefit**: Gives users a clear picture of their progress, helping them identify which subskills are improving and which need more attention.
* **Improvement Rate Insights**:
  * **How It Works**: The app shows the user’s improvement rate for each subskill (e.g., "Your Algebra `theta` is improving by 0.1 per week"). If a subskill’s improvement rate is slow, the app provides a recommendation (e.g., "Focus on Algebra to accelerate your progress").
  * **Benefit**: Helps users understand the pace of their improvement, motivating them to focus on subskills where progress is slower.
* **Pacing Analysis**:
  * **How It Works**: The app displays the average time spent per question for each subskill, highlighting areas where the user is spending too much time (e.g., "You’re spending 90 seconds per question on Reading Comprehension, which is above the target of 60 seconds"). It also provides tips to improve pacing (e.g., "Try skimming passages more quickly").
  * **Benefit**: Helps users identify and address pacing issues, ensuring they can complete the SAT within the time limits.

#### 4. Informing the Review Process

After completing practice sessions or full-length tests, the app uses advanced analytics to provide targeted feedback in the review process, helping users learn from their mistakes and improve.

* **Targeted Review Tasks**:
  * **How It Works**: The app identifies subskills with declining performance trends (e.g., Geometry `theta` dropping from 0.5 to 0.4) and schedules review tasks in the Study Plan (e.g., "Review recent performance in Geometry"). These tasks are prioritized in Phase 3 (Final Review and Refinement) to address persistent weaknesses.
  * **Benefit**: Ensures users focus on subskills where they are struggling, helping them address issues before the test.
* **Pacing Feedback**:
  * **How It Works**: During the review process, the app highlights questions where the user spent excessive time (e.g., "You spent 120 seconds on this Reading Comprehension question"). It provides specific feedback (e.g., "Try to spend less time reading the passage and more time answering the question").
  * **Benefit**: Helps users improve their time management skills by identifying specific pacing issues and offering actionable advice.
* **Subskill-Specific Insights**:
  * **How It Works**: The app analyzes the user’s performance on each subskill during a test or practice session, using `theta` scores and improvement rates to provide insights (e.g., "Your Grammar `theta` improved by 0.2, but your Algebra `theta` dropped by 0.1"). It suggests next steps (e.g., "Focus on Algebra in your next practice session").
  * **Benefit**: Gives users a clear understanding of their performance at the subskill level, helping them target their efforts effectively.

#### 5. Dynamic Adjustments to the Study Plan

The app uses advanced analytics to dynamically adjust the Study Plan, ensuring it remains aligned with the user’s current performance and needs.

* **Reallocation Based on Trends**:
  * **How It Works**: If a subskill’s performance trend becomes negative (e.g., Reading Comprehension `theta` drops from 0.6 to 0.5), the app increases the number of practice sessions for that subskill in the next Study Plan update. If a subskill shows strong improvement (e.g., Grammar `theta` increases from 0.3 to 0.8), the app reduces its focus to allocate more time to other areas.
  * **Benefit**: Keeps the Study Plan relevant by adapting to the user’s progress, ensuring they spend time on the areas that need the most attention.
* **Adjustments for Improvement Rates**:
  * **How It Works**: Subskills with slow improvement rates are given more practice sessions in the Study Plan, while those with fast improvement rates are deprioritized. For example, if a user’s Algebra improvement rate is only 0.05 `theta` per week, the app schedules additional Algebra sessions to help them progress faster.
  * **Benefit**: Ensures balanced improvement across all subskills, preventing users from falling behind in key areas.
* **Pacing Optimization**:
  * **How It Works**: If the app detects pacing issues in a subskill (e.g., excessive time spent on Geometry questions), it schedules pacing tasks in the Study Plan (e.g., "Practice pacing for Geometry"). These tasks are prioritized early in the preparation (Phase 1) to address pacing issues before they impact test performance.
  * **Benefit**: Helps users improve their efficiency, ensuring they can complete the SAT within the time limits.
