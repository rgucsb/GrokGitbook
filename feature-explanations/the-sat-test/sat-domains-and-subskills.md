# SAT Domains and Subskills

The **SAT** (Scholastic Assessment Test), particularly in its current digital format administered through the College Board’s Bluebook app, assesses a student’s readiness for college through two main sections: **Reading and Writing** and **Math**. Each section tests specific **domains** and **subskills** that align with the skills needed for academic success. Below is a comprehensive list of the domains and subskills for the SAT, based on the College Board’s official guidelines and the structure of the digital SAT as of March 2025.

### SAT Domains and Subskills

#### 1. Reading and Writing Section

The Reading and Writing section evaluates a student’s ability to comprehend, analyze, and edit written texts. It combines reading and writing skills into a single section, focusing on critical thinking and language proficiency.

**Domains and Subskills**

* **Domain 1: Craft and Structure**
  * **Words in Context**: Understand the meaning of words and phrases in context, including vocabulary and figurative language.
    * Example: Determine the meaning of a word based on its use in a passage.
  * **Text Structure and Purpose**: Analyze the structure of a text and identify the author’s purpose (e.g., to inform, persuade, entertain).
    * Example: Identify why an author included a specific paragraph in a passage.
  * **Cross-Text Connections**: Compare and contrast ideas across two texts, identifying relationships such as agreement, disagreement, or elaboration.
    * Example: Compare the perspectives of two authors on a historical event.
* **Domain 2: Information and Ideas**
  * **Central Ideas and Details**: Identify the main idea of a passage and supporting details.
    * Example: Determine the central theme of a passage about climate change.
  * **Command of Evidence (Textual and Quantitative)**: Use evidence from texts or data (e.g., charts, graphs) to support conclusions or answer questions.
    * Example: Select a quote from a passage that best supports a given claim.
  * **Inferences**: Draw logical conclusions or make predictions based on the information in a passage.
    * Example: Infer an author’s unstated opinion based on their tone and word choice.
* **Domain 3: Standard English Conventions**
  * **Boundaries**: Edit sentences to correct punctuation and sentence structure (e.g., commas, semicolons, run-on sentences).
    * Example: Correct a sentence by adding a missing comma in a compound sentence.
  * **Form, Structure, and Sense**: Ensure grammatical agreement, verb tense consistency, and logical sentence construction.
    * Example: Choose the correct verb form to maintain tense consistency in a paragraph.
* **Domain 4: Expression of Ideas**
  * **Rhetorical Synthesis**: Combine information from multiple sources (e.g., notes, charts) to form a coherent response.
    * Example: Use notes from a student’s research to complete a sentence about a topic.
  * **Transitions**: Select appropriate transition words or phrases to connect ideas within or between sentences.
    * Example: Choose the best transition word (e.g., "however") to link two contrasting ideas.

**Total Questions in Reading and Writing (Module 1)**

* 27 questions, covering all domains and subskills proportionally.

  * **Nonlinear Functions**: Analyze quadratic, exponential, and other nonlinear functions, including their graphs and transformations.
    * Example: Determine the vertex of the parabola ( y = x^2 - 4x + 3 ).
* **Domain 3: Problem-Solving and Data Analysis**
  * **Ratios, Rates, Proportional Relationships, and Units**: Solve problems involving proportions, unit conversions, and rates.
    * Example: Convert 60 miles per hour to feet per second.
  * **Percentages**: Solve problems involving percentages, including percent change and interest.
    * Example: Calculate a 15% tip on a $50 bill.
  * **One-Variable Data: Distributions and Measures of Center and Spread**: Analyze data sets, calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, and interpret distributions.
    * Example: Find the mean of a data set: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
  * **Two-Variable Data: Models and Scatterplots**: Interpret scatterplots, fit linear models, and calculate correlation.
    * Example: Determine the correlation coefficient for a scatterplot of height vs. weight.
  * **Probability and Conditional Probability**: Calculate probabilities, including conditional probabilities and expected values.
    * Example: Find the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck.
  * **Inference from Sample Statistics and Margin of Error**: Understand sampling, margin of error, and basic statistical inference.
    * Example: Interpret a poll result with a margin of error of ±3%.
  * **Evaluating Statistical Claims: Observational Data and Experiments**: Assess the validity of statistical claims based on study design.
    * Example: Determine if a study’s conclusion is supported by its data.
* **Domain 4: Geometry and Trigonometry**
  * **Area and Volume**: Calculate the area of 2D shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and the volume of 3D shapes (e.g., cylinders, cones).

* Including 27 Reading and Writing questions and 22 Math questions, matching the first modules of the digital SAT.
* Using adaptive IRT to select questions within each domain.
* Ensuring a balanced distribution of subskills within each domain (e.g., selecting questions for Algebra, Geometry, etc., in Math).

#### Database Representation (`frontend/backend/migrations/init_db.py`)

The `Questions` table in the app’s database includes `domain` and `skill` columns to categorize questions:

* **Domains**: "Reading & Writing", "Math"
