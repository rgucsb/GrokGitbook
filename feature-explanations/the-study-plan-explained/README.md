### Key Features of the Study Plan

#### 1. Personalized Task Scheduling

The Study Plan is customized to each user’s specific needs, ensuring that preparation tasks align with their academic strengths, weaknesses, and available study time.

* **User Inputs**: The Study Plan is generated based on user-provided preferences, including:
  * **SAT Test Date**: The date of the user’s scheduled SAT, which determines the preparation timeline.
  * **Study Hours per Week**: The number of hours the user can dedicate to studying each week.
  * **Study Days per Week**: The number of days the user can study each week, ensuring tasks are scheduled on days they are available.
* **Diagnostic Test Results**: The Study Plan uses the results of the Diagnostic Test (49 questions: 27 Reading and Writing, 22 Math) to identify the user’s proficiency (`theta` scores) in each domain (Reading & Writing, Math) and subskill (e.g., Grammar, Algebra). Subskills with lower `theta` scores are prioritized for more practice.
* **Task Allocation**: Tasks are scheduled to focus on weak areas while maintaining a balanced approach across all domains. For example, if a user struggles with Geometry (`theta < 0.5`), the Study Plan will allocate more practice sessions to Geometry while still including tasks for stronger areas like Reading Comprehension.

#### 2. Three-Phase Structure

The Study Plan is divided into three distinct phases, each with a specific focus to ensure a progressive and comprehensive preparation journey.

* **Phase 1: Foundation Building (40% of the preparation time)**:
  * **Focus**: Build a strong foundation by addressing core weaknesses and reviewing fundamental concepts.
  * **Tasks**: Short practice sessions (e.g., "Complete a 5-question session in Grammar") targeting weak subskills, along with pacing exercises for subskills where the user spends excessive time (e.g., "Practice pacing for Reading Comprehension").
  * **Full-Length Tests**: Includes 2 full-length SAT practice tests (49 questions, 72 minutes each) to familiarize users with the test format early in their preparation.
* **Phase 2: Practice and Strategy (30% of the preparation time)**:
  * **Focus**: Apply concepts in test-like conditions and develop test-taking strategies such as time management and question elimination.
  * **Tasks**: Longer practice sessions (e.g., "Complete a 10-question session in Algebra"), strategy-focused tasks (e.g., "Review strategies for Geometry" for subskills with slow improvement), and 2 full-length SAT practice tests to simulate the test experience.
* **Phase 3: Final Review and Refinement (30% of the preparation time)**:
  * **Focus**: Fine-tune skills, address remaining weaknesses, and build confidence for test day.
  * **Tasks**: Targeted review sessions (e.g., "Review incorrect answers from Grammar practice"), performance analysis for subskills with declining trends (e.g., "Review recent performance in Algebra"), test-day preparation (e.g., "Review test-day checklist"), and 4 full-length SAT practice tests to ensure readiness.

#### 3. Advanced Analytics Integration

The Study Plan leverages advanced analytics to make task allocation more precise and effective, ensuring that preparation is tailored to the user’s evolving needs.

* **Performance Trends**: The app analyzes the user’s `theta` scores over time to identify subskills with improving, declining, or stagnant performance. Subskills with negative or stagnant trends (e.g., no improvement in Geometry over two weeks) are prioritized for additional practice.
* **Improvement Rates**: The app calculates the rate of improvement for each subskill (e.g., `theta` change per week). Subskills with slow improvement rates (e.g., less than 0.1 `theta` per week) receive more practice sessions, while those with fast improvement (e.g., more than 0.2 `theta` per week) are deprioritized to focus on other areas.
* **Time Spent per Question**: The app tracks the average time spent per question for each subskill. If a user spends excessive time (e.g., more than 60 seconds per question) on a subskill like Reading Comprehension, the Study Plan includes pacing tasks to improve efficiency.

#### 4. Dynamic Full-Length Test Scheduling

The Study Plan includes a total of 8 full-length SAT practice tests, strategically scheduled across the three phases to ensure a balanced preparation experience.

* **Phase 1**: 2 full-length tests, scheduled evenly across the phase to introduce users to the SAT format early.
* **Phase 2**: 2 full-length tests, scheduled to provide practice under test-like conditions as users refine their strategies.
* **Phase 3**: 4 full-length tests, scheduled more frequently in the final weeks to simulate the test experience and build endurance and confidence.
* **Dynamic Scheduling**: The tests are distributed evenly within each phase based on the number of weeks, ensuring users have consistent opportunities to practice the full SAT format (49 questions, 72 minutes) throughout their preparation.

#### 5. Regular Updates Based on Progress

The Study Plan is not static; it updates regularly to reflect the user’s latest performance and ensure the preparation remains relevant.

* **Weekly Updates**: The app automatically updates the Study Plan every week, incorporating the latest `theta` scores from practice sessions and full-length tests. This ensures that tasks are reallocated to focus on new or persistent weak areas.
* **Post-Test Updates**: After completing a practice session or full-length test, the app updates the Study Plan to reflect the user’s updated `theta` scores, adjusting the focus on subskills as needed.
* **Preservation of Completed Tasks**: Completed tasks are preserved during updates, ensuring users maintain a sense of progress while the remaining tasks are reoptimized based on the latest data.

#### 6. Gamification and Motivation

The Study Plan integrates with the app’s gamification features to keep users motivated and engaged throughout their preparation.

* **Points for Tasks**: Each task in the Study Plan is assigned points (e.g., 50 points for a 5-question session, 150 points for a full-length test). Completing tasks earns users points, which contribute to their overall score and leaderboard ranking.
* **Rewards and Challenges**: Completing Study Plan tasks unlocks rewards (e.g., avatars, badges) and contributes to daily challenges (e.g., "Complete 3 Study Plan tasks today"), encouraging consistent engagement.
* **Progress Tracking**: The app displays the user’s progress through the Study Plan, showing completed tasks, upcoming tasks, and overall phase completion, providing a sense of accomplishment and momentum.

#### 7. Flexibility and Adjustments

The Study Plan is designed to be flexible, allowing users to adjust their preparation as their schedule or goals change.

* **Manual Adjustments**: Users can update their study hours per week or study days per week from the dashboard, triggering a recalculation of the Study Plan to fit their new preferences.
* **Adaptive Reallocation**: If a user’s performance improves significantly in a subskill (e.g., Grammar `theta` increases from 0.3 to 0.8), the Study Plan automatically reduces focus on that subskill and reallocates sessions to other areas needing improvement (e.g., Geometry).

#### 8. Integration with Other App Features

The Study Plan works seamlessly with other features of the SAT Smart Prep App to create a cohesive preparation experience.

* **Diagnostic Test**: The initial Study Plan is generated based on the Diagnostic Test results, ensuring it targets the user’s specific weaknesses from the start.
* **Practice Sessions**: Study Plan tasks link directly to practice sessions, allowing users to complete tasks like "Complete a 5-question session in Algebra" by navigating to the practice section of the app.
* **Progress Monitoring**: The app tracks the user’s progress through the Study Plan, updating `theta` scores and analytics after each task, which informs future updates to the plan.
* **Review Process**: After completing full-length tests, users can review their performance, and the Study Plan incorporates this feedback to schedule targeted review tasks (e.g., "Review incorrect answers from Grammar practice").
