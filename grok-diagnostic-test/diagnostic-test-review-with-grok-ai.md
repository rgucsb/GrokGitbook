# Diagnostic Test review with Grok AI

Below is an updated version of the interactive SAT diagnostic results review script that integrates AI using **Grok**, the conversational AI from xAI (simulated here as a function). The AI enhances the chat by generating dynamic, supportive responses tailored to the student’s performance and input, making it feel more human-like and adaptive. It connects proficiency levels to estimated SAT scores, uses actual diagnostic data, and maintains an interactive, step-by-step format.

Since I can’t directly call an external AI like Grok in this environment, I’ve implemented a simulated AI response generator (`ai_respond`) that mimics Grok’s tone and reasoning. In a real application, you’d replace this with an API call to xAI’s Grok service.

#### How It Works

1. **AI Integration**:
   * **`ai_respond`**: Simulates Grok by generating context-aware responses:
     * Uses predefined positive and encouraging phrases to maintain a supportive tone.
     * Tailors messages based on context (e.g., greeting, domain review) and data (e.g., scores, proficiencies).
     * In a real app, replace with an xAI API call: `response = xai_api_call(context, data)`.
   * Responses are dynamic, varying slightly with `random.choice` for a natural feel.
2. **Interactivity**:
   * Prompts the student at each step (e.g., “Say 'yes'!”) and waits for input.
   * Skips sections if the student says anything other than “yes”, keeping it flexible.
3. **Score Mapping**:
   * `proficiency_to_sat_score`: Maps proficiency (1–7) to SAT scores (200–800), as before:
     * 1 = 200, 4 = 500, 7 = 800, with linear interpolation.
   * Domain scores are approximated as contributions to the section total (divided by number of domains).
4. **Chat Flow**:
   * **Greeting**: AI introduces itself and asks to start.
   * **Overall**: Shows estimated SAT scores and explains the process if requested.
   * **Math**: Overview, domains, optional skills with AI feedback.
   * **Reading/Writing**: Same structure.
   * **Wrap-Up**: Summarizes with top strengths and improvements.
5. **Data-Driven**:
   * Uses actual proficiency scores from `results` (e.g., Nonlinear Functions: 6, Probability: 2).
   * Identifies strengths (≥5) and improvements (≤3) with specific examples.

#### Sample Interaction

With `SAMPLE_RESULTS`:

```
Hey there! I’m Grok, your SAT prep buddy. You’ve got this! Let’s dive into your diagnostic results together—ready?
[2s pause]
>> yes

Here’s the big picture: your Math score is 530/800, and Reading/Writing is 480/800. That’s 1010/1600—awesome! Want to know how we got those numbers?
[3s pause]
>> yes

Alright! Your Math theta was 1.23, and Reading/Writing was 0.87. We turn those into proficiencies (1-7), then map them to SAT scores: 1 is 200, 4 is 500, 7 is 800. Cool, right?
[2s pause]

Let’s talk Math! Your estimated score is 530/800—great work! It’s split into four areas. Want to check them out?
[2s pause]
>> yes

In Algebra, you averaged 4.2/7, adding about 130 points to your score. That’s solid! Keep that momentum going!
[2s pause]
In Advanced Math, you averaged 4.3/7, adding about 132 points to your score. That’s solid! Keep that momentum going!
[2s pause]
...
Want the nitty-gritty on your Math skills? Say 'yes'!
>> yes

Algebra Skills:
- Linear Equations in One Variable: 4/7
[1s pause]
- Linear Functions: 5/7
[1s pause]
...
Your Math Strengths:
You crushed Linear Functions with a 5/7! You’re a rockstar!
[1s pause]
You crushed Nonlinear Functions with a 6/7! I’m so proud of you!
[1s pause]
...
Areas to Boost:
One-Variable Data: Distributions and Measures of Center and Spread was 2/7. We’ll boost this up together!
[1s pause]
...
You’re incredible! Your total SAT score is 1010/1600—awesome! You’re shining in Linear Functions (5/7) and Nonlinear Functions (6/7), and we’ll power up One-Variable Data: Distributions and Measures of Center and Spread (2/7) and Probability and Conditional Probability (2/7) together. What’s next on your SAT prep adventure?
```

#### AI Integration Details

1. **Simulated Grok (`ai_respond`)**:
   * Generates responses based on context and data, mimicking Grok’s supportive tone.
   *   Example real API call (pseudo-code):

       ```python
       import xai_api  # Hypothetical xAI library
       def ai_respond(context, data):
           prompt = f"Generate a supportive response for a student reviewing SAT results. Context: {context}, Data: {json.dumps(data)}"
           return xai_api.call_grok(prompt)
       ```
2. **Benefits**:
   * **Personalization**: AI adapts to the student’s scores and responses (e.g., more encouragement for low scores).
   * **Natural Flow**: Varies phrasing to avoid repetition, enhancing engagement.
   * **Scalability**: Real Grok could analyze student input (e.g., “I’m nervous”) and respond dynamically.

***

#### Integration into a Smart SAT Test Prep App

1. **Backend**:
   *   Replace `ai_respond` with an xAI Grok API call:

       ```python
       import requests
       def ai_respond(context, data):
           response = requests.post("https://api.xai.com/grok", json={"prompt": context, "data": data})
           return response.json()["response"]
       ```
   * Fetch results: `results = requests.get(f"http://backend-api/diagnostic/results?user_id={user_id}").json()`.
2. **Frontend**:
   * Use a chat UI (e.g., React) with WebSocket or polling to send/receive messages.
   * Replace `time.sleep` with user-driven progression (e.g., “Next” button).
3. **Real Data**:
   * Ensure `diagnostic_results.json` matches the diagnostic output format.

***

#### Testing

* **Standalone**: Run with `SAMPLE_RESULTS` or a real `diagnostic_results.json`. Test “yes”/“no” inputs and verify AI responses.
* **Score Accuracy**: Check SAT scores (e.g., Math: 530, R\&W: 480) align with proficiencies (Math: \~4.3, R\&W: \~4.0).
* **AI Responses**: Ensure tone remains positive and data references (e.g., “Nonlinear Functions (6/7)”) are correct.

This AI-enhanced chat provides a dynamic, supportive review, connecting skills to SAT scores in an engaging way! Let me know if you’d like further tweaks or real API integration details!
