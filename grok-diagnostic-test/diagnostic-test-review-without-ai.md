# Diagnostic Test Review without AI

Below is an updated Python script that makes the SAT diagnostic results review interactive and connects proficiency levels (1–7) to estimated SAT scores. The script uses a conversational chat format with real-time user input, remains supportive and positive, and maps proficiency scores to SAT section scores (200–800 scale) based on a simplified scoring model. It assumes results are loaded from a JSON file generated by the previous diagnostic test code and uses sample data if no file is provided.

#### How It Works

1. **Interactivity**:
   * Uses `input()` to prompt the student at key points (e.g., “Say 'yes'!”), waiting for responses before proceeding.
   * Allows skipping detailed breakdowns if the student declines, keeping the chat flexible.
2. **Score Mapping**:
   * `proficiency_to_sat_score`: Maps average proficiency (1–7) to SAT section scores (200–800):
     * Proficiency 1 = 200 (minimum score).
     * Proficiency 4 = 500 (average SAT score).
     * Proficiency 7 = 800 (maximum score).
     * Linear interpolation between levels (100 points per proficiency step), rounded to the nearest 10.
   * Domain contributions are approximated by dividing the section score by the number of domains (4 for Math, 3 for Reading/Writing).
3. **Chat Flow**:
   * **Greeting**: Welcomes the student and asks for confirmation to proceed.
   * **Overall Performance**: Shows estimated SAT scores based on average proficiencies.
   * **Math Review**: Overview with score, domain-level breakdown, optional skill details.
   * **Reading/Writing Review**: Same structure as Math.
   * **Wrap-Up**: Summarizes strengths and improvement areas with encouragement.
4. **Data-Driven Feedback**:
   * Uses actual proficiency scores from `results` (e.g., Nonlinear Functions: 6, Probability: 2).
   * Highlights strengths (≥5) and improvements (≤3) with specific examples.
5. **Tone**:
   * Positive and supportive (e.g., “You’re crushing it!”, “We’ll boost this up together!”).
   * Pauses (1–3 seconds) simulate a natural conversation pace.

#### Connecting to Actual SAT Scores

* **Mapping**: The SAT scores (200–800 per section) are estimated from proficiency averages. This is a simplification:
  * Real SAT scoring uses a raw score (number correct) converted via a curve, which varies per test form.
  * Here, proficiency (1–7) approximates performance across skills, scaled to 200–800.
* **Accuracy**: For precise SAT score prediction, integrate raw score data from the diagnostic (e.g., number correct per difficulty level) and use official SAT score conversion tables. This script provides an educational estimate.

***

#### Integration into a Smart SAT Test Prep App

1. **Backend**:
   * Fetch results via API: `results = requests.get(f"http://backend-api/diagnostic/results?user_id={user_id}").json()`.
   * Store chat state (e.g., current step) in a database or session.
2. **Frontend**:
   * Use a chat UI (e.g., React with WebSocket or polling) to display messages and collect input.
   * Replace `time.sleep` with asynchronous delays or user-driven progression (e.g., “Next” button).
3. **Real Data**:
   * Replace `SAMPLE_RESULTS` with actual diagnostic output matching the JSON structure.

***

#### Testing

* **Standalone**: Run with `SAMPLE_RESULTS` or a real `diagnostic_results.json`. Test “yes” and “no” inputs at each prompt.
* **Score Validation**: Check estimated scores (e.g., Math: 530, R\&W: 480) align with proficiency averages (Math: \~4.3, R\&W: \~4.0).
* **Interactivity**: Ensure the chat pauses and waits for input correctly.
