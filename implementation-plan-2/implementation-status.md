# Implementation Status

This section classifies each route based on its implementation status.

#### Complete Implementation

These routes have full implementation with proper error handling, input validation, database integration, and business logic:

1. Authentication Routes:
   * POST /register - Full user registration with validation
   * POST /login - Complete login flow with password verification
   * POST /refresh - Token refresh implementation
   * GET /me - Current user retrieval
   * POST /logout - Basic logout functionality
2. Practice Routes:
   * POST /sessions - Complete session creation
   * GET /sessions/:id - Full session retrieval
   * POST /sessions/:sessionId/responses - Complete response handling
   * PUT /sessions/:id/end - Full session end functionality
3. Chat Routes:
   * POST /message - Complete message processing with OpenAI integration
   * GET /history - Full history retrieval
   * DELETE /history - Complete history clearing
   * GET /suggestions - Full suggestions implementation
4. Diagnostic Routes:
   * GET / - Complete session initialization
   * POST /answer - Full answer submission
   * GET /results/:sessionId - Complete results calculation
   * GET /session/:sessionId - Full session retrieval
   * GET /result/:resultId - Complete result retrieval

#### Partial Implementation

These routes have basic functionality but may lack some features or refinements:

1. OAuth Routes:
   * GET /oauth/:provider - Basic flow implemented
   * GET /callback/:provider - Basic callback handling
2. Question Routes:
   * GET / - Basic question retrieval
   * GET /adaptive - Basic adaptive selection
   * GET /:id - Basic question fetching
   * POST / - Basic question creation

#### Minimal/No Implementation

These routes are defined but have minimal or no backend implementation:

1. Study Plan Routes:
   * Most study plan endpoints are defined but need full implementation
   * Progress tracking endpoints need implementation
   * Snapshot generation needs implementation
2. User Routes:
   * GET /progress - Needs implementation
   * GET /:id/progress - Needs implementation

The classification is based on:

1. Presence of complete controller logic
2. Error handling implementation
3. Input validation
4. Database integration
5. Business logic implementation
6. Service layer integration
