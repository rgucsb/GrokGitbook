# College board partnership

To secure a partnership with the College Board for the **SAT Prep Suite** (also referred to as **LearnerLabs SAT Prep App** in the onboarding context), we need a strategic plan that aligns with the College Board’s mission, demonstrates mutual value, and leverages the SAT Prep Suite’s strengths (e.g., Bluebook-aligned UI, AI-driven personalization, gamification, and accessibility features). The College Board is a mission-driven, not-for-profit organization focused on connecting students to college success, as evidenced by its partnerships with organizations like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Khan Academy, and Matriculate. These partnerships emphasize expanding access, providing personalized resources, and supporting underserved communities. Our strategy will position the SAT Prep Suite as a valuable partner that enhances the College Board’s goals while benefiting from official content and credibility.

### Strategy and Plan to Secure a College Board Partnership

#### 1. Understand the College Board’s Mission and Priorities

The College Board’s mission is to connect students to college success and opportunity, with a focus on:

* **Access and Equity**: Supporting low-income, first-generation, rural, and underrepresented students (e.g., partnerships with Matriculate and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to provide free advising and resources).
* **Personalized Pathways**: Offering tools like BigFuture and Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy to help students plan for college and improve scores.
* **Digital Transformation**: Transitioning to a digital SAT (announced January 25, 2022) with features like a 2-hour test, relevant topics, and calculator use in Math sections.
* **Research and Innovation**: Collaborating with partners to pilot programs (e.g., FAFSA assistance with Benefits Data Trust) and conduct research on academic motivation (e.g., with Angela Duckworth and Greg Walton).

**SAT Prep Suite Alignment**:

* The app’s Bluebook-aligned UI and adaptive diagnostics align with the digital SAT transition.
* Features like offline mode and gamification can expand access to underserved communities.
* AI-driven personalization and analytics support the College Board’s focus on tailored student pathways.

#### 2. Define the Value Proposition for the College Board

To secure a partnership, we must demonstrate how the SAT Prep Suite adds value to the College Board’s mission while benefiting from the collaboration.

**Value for the College Board**

* **Enhanced Student Preparation**: The SAT Prep Suite’s Bluebook-aligned UI provides a realistic practice environment, helping students prepare for the digital SAT more effectively than competitors like Acely and LearnQ.ai, which lack this alignment.
* **Access for Underserved Communities**: Offline mode and gamified engagement (daily challenges, leaderboards, virtual rewards) can reach rural and low-income students, aligning with the College Board’s equity goals.
* **Data-Driven Insights**: The app’s analytics (proficiency trends, pacing analysis) can provide the College Board with aggregated data on student performance, supporting their research initiatives (e.g., academic motivation studies).
* **Scalable AI Tutoring**: The AI tutor (with planned enhancements for real voice input and advanced NLP) can complement Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy, offering a more interactive experience.

**Value for SAT Prep Suite**

* **Official Content**: Access to official SAT practice questions and tests, enhancing credibility and attracting users seeking authentic materials (similar to Khan Academy’s partnership).
* **Brand Credibility**: Association with the College Board boosts trust, helping SAT Prep Suite compete with Acely and LearnQ.ai.
* **User Growth**: Leveraging the College Board’s reach (7 million students annually) to scale to 2,000 active users by the end of 2025.
* **Research Collaboration**: Participation in College Board research initiatives (e.g., academic motivation) to improve AI-driven features.

#### 3. Strategic Approach to Partnership

The College Board values partnerships that align with its mission, involve mutual collaboration, and prioritize student outcomes. Based on their history (e.g., partnerships with Khan Academy, Matriculate, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), they prefer partners who can scale access, provide innovative tools, and support underserved communities. Our approach will focus on building relationships, demonstrating value through a pilot, and formalizing a long-term partnership.
