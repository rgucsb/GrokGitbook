# Gap Analysis

To perform a **gap analysis** for the **SAT Prep Suite** (referred to as **LearnerLabs SAT Prep App** in the onboarding context), I’ll evaluate the current state of the app against the desired state of being the best AI-based SAT test prep app, as outlined in the strategic plan to surpass competitors like **Acely**, **LearnQ.ai**, **R.test.ai**, **HighScores AI**, **Mento Mind**, **SmartPrep.ai**, and **EduAide.ai**. The analysis will identify missing features, assess their importance, and prioritize them based on their impact on user experience, engagement, and market competitiveness as of March 27, 2025. I’ll also consider the recent additions (e.g., enhanced gamification, onboarding wizard) and compare the app’s capabilities to the requirements set in the Market Requirements Document (MRD) and Product Requirements Document (PRD).

  * **Impact**: WCAG compliance would broaden the user base, especially for users with disabilities.
  * **Action**: Implement screen reader support, high-contrast mode, and adjustable fonts.
* **Performance Optimization**:
  * **Impact**: Reducing latency to < 300ms improves user experience, especially on mobile.
  * **Action**: Use AWS Lambda and optimize caching.
* **School/Tutor Partnerships**:
  * **Impact**: Partnerships would expand reach, competing with **LearnQ.ai**’s school integrations.
  * **Action**: Offer bulk licensing and free tutor accounts.

#### 7. Conclusion

The SAT Prep Suite is well-positioned with its Bluebook-aligned UI, gamification, and onboarding, but addressing the identified gaps will make it the best AI-based SAT test prep app. High-priority gaps (test coverage, AI tutor, mobile apps, partnerships, marketing) should be tackled first to maximize user acquisition and engagement, followed by medium-priority gaps to enhance user experience and outcomes. This roadmap ensures the app meets its goal of 2,000 active users, 90% test completion rate, and NPS >60 by the end of 2025. Let me know if you’d like to implement any of these features next!
