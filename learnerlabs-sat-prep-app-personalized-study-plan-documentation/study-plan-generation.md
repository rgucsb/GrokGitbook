# Study Plan Generation



I've provided a comprehensive implementation of the study plan generation system for the SAT prep app. This code demonstrates how personalized study plans are created based on diagnostic test results, user profiles, and skill proficiencies.

#### Key Components of the Study Plan Generator:

1. **Type Definitions (`types.ts`)**
2. Defines all data structures used in the study plan system
3. Includes interfaces for user profiles, skill proficiencies, study phases, and activities
4. **Study Plan Generator (`study-plan-generator.ts`)**
5. Main function that orchestrates the entire plan generation process
6. Creates a three-phase structure (Foundation, Skill Building, Test Readiness)
7. Calculates appropriate durations for each phase based on available time
8. **Skill Prioritization (`skill-prioritization.ts`)**
9. Analyzes diagnostic results to identify skill gaps
10. Prioritizes skills based on proficiency, importance, and user preferences
11. Uses a weighted formula to calculate priority scores
12. **Study Intensity Calculator (`study-intensity.ts`)**
13. Determines recommended weekly study hours
14. Factors in score gap, time until test, and urgency
15. Ensures recommendations are realistic and achievable
16. **Milestone Generator (`milestone-generator.ts`)**
17. Creates meaningful milestones throughout the study plan
18. Sets target scores for each phase
19. Includes skill-specific and phase-specific milestones
20. **Weekly Schedule Generator (`schedule-generator.ts`)**
21. Builds detailed weekly schedules with specific activities
22. Allocates time based on skill priorities and phase objectives
23. Creates a balanced mix of lessons, practice, and assessments
24. **Demo Component (`study-plan-generator.tsx`)**
25. Provides a user interface to generate and view study plans
26. Uses mock data to demonstrate the functionality
27. Shows key information about the generated plan

#### How the System Works:

1. The process begins with diagnostic test results that identify skill proficiencies
2. The system prioritizes skills based on gaps and importance
3. A three-phase study plan is created with appropriate durations
4. Each phase has specific focus areas with time allocations
5. Milestones are set throughout the plan to track progress
6. A detailed weekly schedule is generated with specific activities
7. The plan adapts based on the time available until the test date

This implementation demonstrates the sophisticated algorithm that powers the personalized study plan feature, creating tailored learning paths that maximize improvement based on each student's unique needs and timeline.
