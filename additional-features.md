   Section-specific timed practice to build speed and endurance\
   Performance analytics under timed conditions to identify where speed affects accuracy
2. Error Analysis and Mistake Tracking\
   Mistake categorization system to classify errors (e.g., careless, concept misunderstanding, time pressure)\
   Recurring mistake patterns identification across practice sessions\
   Personalized error logs with explanations and remediation strategies
3. Spaced Repetition System\
   Automated review scheduling based on forgetting curves\
   Targeted review of previously missed questions\
   Concept reinforcement at optimal intervals for long-term retention
4. Collaborative Learning\
   Peer study groups for collaborative problem-solving\
   Discussion forums for specific question types or concepts\
   Tutor-student connection for personalized guidance
5. Content-Specific Resources\
   Video explanations for complex concepts\
   Strategy guides for specific question types\
   Formula sheets and quick reference materials\
   Vocabulary builders for the reading section
6. Test-Taking Strategy Training\
