* **Accessibility**: Offline mode for students with limited internet access.
* **Support for Tutors/Parents**: Analytics and notifications to track student progress.
* **Social Features**: Community engagement (posts, comments, friends) to reduce isolation during prep.

**2.4 Competitive Landscape**

* **Khan Academy**: Free SAT prep with official College Board partnership, lacks gamification and social features.
* **The Princeton Review**: Comprehensive but expensive ($500-$2,000), limited personalization.
* **Kaplan**: Offers adaptive learning but lacks offline mode and social features.
* **UWorld**: Strong question bank, but UI is less intuitive than Bluebook.
* **Competitive Advantage**:
  * Bluebook-inspired UI for Reading/Writing and Math layouts.
  * AI-driven tutoring with voice input.
  * Offline mode with sync.
  * Gamification and social features for engagement.

#### 3. Market Opportunity

* **Gap**: Existing tools lack a combination of Bluebook-aligned UI, AI tutoring, offline capabilities, and social engagement.
