# Prioritized Implementation Plan

Based on the current state of route implementations, here's a prioritized list for completing the remaining functionality:

**Priority 1: Core User Experience Routes**\
<mark style="color:blue;">Study Plan Core Routes</mark>

POST /plans - Create study plan\
GET /plans/:id - Get specific plan\
GET /plans/user/:userId - Get user's study plans\
Rationale: These are fundamental to the study plan feature and directly impact the user experience. Without these, the study plan feature is unusable.

<mark style="color:blue;">User Progress Routes</mark>

GET /progress - Get current user's progress\
GET /:id/progress - Get specific user's progress\
Rationale: Progress tracking is essential for users to understand their learning journey and is likely displayed prominently in the UI.

**Priority 2: Enhanced Learning Features**\
<mark style="color:blue;">Question Routes Improvements</mark>

Enhance GET /adaptive - Improve adaptive question selection algorithm\
Enhance GET /:id - Add more comprehensive question data\
Rationale: These routes already have basic functionality but improving them will enhance the quality of practice sessions.

<mark style="color:blue;">OAuth Routes Improvements</mark>

Enhance GET /oauth/:provider and GET /callback/:provider - Improve error handling and user experience\
Rationale: These routes work but could benefit from better error handling and user experience improvements.

**Priority 3: Study Plan Management**\
<mark style="color:blue;">Study Plan Goal Routes</mark>

GET /plans/:planId/goals - Get plan goals\
PUT /goals/:id - Update goal\
PUT /plans/:planId/goals/progress - Update goal progress\
Rationale: Goals are a key component of study plans but depend on the core plan routes being implemented first.

<mark style="color:blue;">Study Plan Task Routes</mark>

GET /plans/:planId/tasks - Get plan tasks\
GET /tasks/:id - Get specific task\
PUT /tasks/:id - Update task\
POST /tasks/:id/complete - Complete task\
POST /plans/:planId/tasks/generate - Generate new tasks\
Rationale: Tasks provide actionable items for users but depend on goals being implemented.

**Priority 4: Analytics and Progress Tracking**\
<mark style="color:blue;">Study Plan Progress Routes</mark>

GET /plans/:planId/progress/analyze - Analyze progress\
POST /plans/:planId/snapshots/weekly - Generate weekly snapshot\
POST /plans/:planId/snapshots/monthly - Generate monthly snapshot\
GET /plans/:planId/snapshots/latest/:type - Get latest snapshot\
GET /plans/:planId/snapshots - Get all snapshots\
Rationale: These provide valuable insights but are less critical for core functionality and depend on other study plan features.

<mark style="color:blue;">Test Result Routes</mark>

POST /test-results - Create test result\
GET /test-results/user/:userId - Get user's test results\
GET /test-results/:id - Get specific test result\
Rationale: These support the analytics features but depend on other components being in place first.

Implementation Approach Recommendations:\
Incremental Development: Implement one group at a time, starting with Priority 1\
Test-Driven Development: Write tests before implementing each route\
Consistent Error Handling: Apply the same error handling patterns used in completed routes\
Database Integration: Ensure proper Prisma model usage and transaction handling\
Documentation: Update API documentation as each group is completed\
Frontend Coordination: Coordinate with frontend team to ensure UI components are ready to use the newly implemented routes\
This prioritization balances user impact, feature dependencies, and implementation complexity to provide the most value to users as quickly as possible.
